"""
Constructor : 
Constructor is executed when we create the object of this class. 
In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.
Each time an object is created a method is called. That methods is named the constructor.
"""
""" 
Types of constructors : 

default constructor: The default constructor is a simple constructor which doesnâ€™t accept any arguments. 
Its definition has only one argument which is a reference to the instance being constructed.
parameterized constructor: constructor with parameters is known as parameterized constructor. 
The parameterized constructor takes its first argument as a reference to the instance being constructed known as self and the rest of the arguments are provided by the programmer.
